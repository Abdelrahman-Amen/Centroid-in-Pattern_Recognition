# Centroid-Based Pattern Recognitionüèù
## Introduction
Centroid-based pattern recognition is a technique used in computer vision and image processing for feature extraction and classification. This repository contains Python code that implements a centroid-based pattern recognition system. The system extracts features from images based on the centroids of grid cells and uses a Decision Tree Classifier or Random Forest Classifier for image classification.

## Features


‚Ä¢Extracts features from images based on centroids of grid cells.




‚Ä¢Utilizes a Decision Tree Classifier or Random Forest Classifier for image classification.



‚Ä¢Allows for customization of grid dimensions.
















This project aims to demonstrate the application of centroid-based feature extraction in pattern recognition tasks, particularly in image classification. By dividing the image into a grid and calculating the centroids of each grid cell, we can extract meaningful features for classification.

In initial experiments, a Decision Tree Classifier was used for classification. However, further experimentation revealed that utilizing a Random Forest Classifier yielded higher accuracy. This highlights the importance of exploring different classifiers and parameters to achieve optimal performance in pattern recognition tasks.


## Note
‚Ä¢This implementation is for educational purposes and may require customization for specific applications.




‚Ä¢Ensure that images used for classification are appropriately preprocessed and labeled.
